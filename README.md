The Riggings
=================

[ ![Codeship Status for wearehanno/riggings](https://codeship.io/projects/62ff1160-09e4-0132-177d-4af473c3e2ac/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.io/projects/31635)

Prototype fast, and deploy to a server for feedback and staging! This is the internal repo we use at [Hanno](http://hanno.co/) for rapid prototyping.


##What's included?

1. Middleman prototyping setup using [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) Sass, via [Bower](http://bower.io/). Bootstrap is available as an alternative - just scroll down this README to the PICKFRAMEWORK section)
3. [CodeShip](http://codeship.io/), for CI testing and automated deployment to our server
4. [Slack](http://slack.com) configuration sensible preferences, to keep the team updated.


##Step 1: install the app locally

Software installation, before we can dig into the repo:

1. Install a [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) version via RVM
2. Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
3. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) (`$ npm install -g bower`)

Clone this repo into `~/.middleman` (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

`$ git clone git://github.com/wearehanno/riggings.git ~/.middleman/riggings`

Then create a new project using zurb-foundation template.

1. `$ middleman init my_new_project --template=riggings`
2. `$ cd my_new_project`
3. `$ rm -rf -- .git` to delete the template's git repo, which is copied into this repo too, and you won't want it
4. `$ bower install` to install web package dependencies for the project
5. `$ bundle` to install Ruby gems (including Middleman)
6. `$ middleman s` to start the Middleman server

You'll then be able to see the site at [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). For more help follow [Middleman's project template instructions](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/welcome/).


##Step 2: Add the project to GitHub

The first person in the team to build the app needs to set it up on GitHub. Go create a new repo on GitHub for the project. Mark it as private, if it's a client one.

2. `$ cd` to this repository
3. `$ git init`
4. `$ git add .`
5. `$ git commit -m 'First commit of scaffold'`
6. `$ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/repositoryname.git`
7. `$ git push -u origin master`
8. `$ git checkout -b develop`
9. `$ git push origin develop`


##Step 3: Configure CodeShip tests and build

It's possible to upload files via FTP to a server, but this introduces too many breakable points. Instead, we'll use CodeShip to streamline the process and make sure nobody breaks the build accidentally.

First, visit [codeship.io](https://codeship.io), login, and click to create a new project. Select the GitHub option and choose the repo from GitHub.

First, we need to set up the CodeShip server before running tests. We use a few commands to load dependencies. Enter the following **setup commands**:

    rvm use 2.1.0
    bundle install
    npm install -g bower
    bower install

Now, we need to specify the commands that run our test suite. We'll just do a simple Middleman build for now, but we could add better integration testing later on if we wanted to. Enter the following **test commands**:

    bundle exec middleman build

Next, save your project, and push to the GitHub repo to trigger a build and make sure it's being correctly built, showing up as a green build. If it fails, you've got an issue, because the tests should all pass on the clean scaffolding repo.


##Step 4: Build a server

It's perfectly possible to [deploy to S3](http://blog.codeship.io/2014/02/04/continuous-deployment-static-pages-amazon-s3.html) with CodeShip, but for now, let's deploy to a server, because we might need to password-protect the files while we're working on the project.

We usually use a simple Lamp stack hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), so we can have easily provisionable servers to build on.

You'll need to:

* Create a server
* Add the CodeShip deploy key as an authorized key on that server
* Note down a valid username, and the server IP

Hanno team members can follow our [internal setup instructions](https://docs.google.com/a/wearehanno.com/document/d/12cRX8vjLjyqlzAuStE_fdsonuAB53dqP-aKrZo_UQW0/edit?usp=sharing) for our DigitalOcean box setup.


##Step 5: Configure CodeShip deployment

###Set up the script command for staging

We’ll do a basic copy of the compiled middleman build directory (`/tmp`) from the `~clone` directory which CodeShip creates on their server when they run tests and setup tasks. All we need to define is the server access details (username, server IP, and the path to deploy to on the server).

Next, click to go to **Next Steps** in CodeShip.

1. Click the option at the top for setup of **Continuous Deployment**
2. Go back to CodeShip and select **+ Add a branch to deploy**
3. Enter **develop** as the branch name
4. Select **$script** as the deployment method

Here’s an example to deploy to Hanno staging:

    scp -rpC ~/clone/tmp/ username@serverip:/home/username/public_html/xxxx/
    
    # Now rewrite the folder names to replace the existing public_html
    ssh username@serverip 'mv /home/username/public_html/xxxx/public_html /home/username/public_html/xxxx/old_public_html'
    ssh username@serverip 'mv /home/username/public_html/xxxx/tmp /home/username/public_html/xxxx/public_html'
    ssh username@serverip 'rm -rf /home/username/public_html/xxxx/old_public_html'
    

###Later on, you can set up the Production deployment too

Here's an example $script for deploying to a DO box containing a client site:

    scp -rpC ~/clone/tmp/ root@111.111.111.111:/var/www/xxxx.com

This would be added to the master branch settings on CodeShip, so that when you save, CodeShip will run the command on your next master branch push.


## Step 6: Configure notifications and connectors

Keep clients and team members updated at every step of the process. We use Slack massively, and pipe lots of notifications into a project room where our team and clients can discuss things.

### Add Slack connections

Configure the following inside Slack > Configure Integrations:

* GitHub > Slack (if desired)
* CodeShip > Slack


## Step 7: Picking a Framework (Bootstrap vs Foundation)

Yup, we feel that way sometimes, too. Riggings is set up for Foundation but can easily be switched to Bootstrap.

Search in this repo for PICKFRAMEWORK. There are sections in 6 files, which you'll need to modify. Even if you want to stick with Foundation, you should still follow these steps just to remove the Bootstrap references so that you have a clean repository:

1. In `bower.json`, choose the framework you need and copy it into the dependencies
2. In `config.rb` adjust the `config.add_import_path`
3. In `all.js` change the framework JS file being included
4. In `app.js` remove the Foundation initialisation at `$(document).foundation();`
5. In `app.css.scss`, there are a few lines at the top to import the Sass components
6. In `layout.erb` there's a call to Modernizr, which we don't need for Bootstrap

Then, when you're done, we need to change the framework via Bower:

    $ bower prune # To remove the unused bower components
    $ bower install # To install the new ones

And finally, update the `source/layouts/layout.erb` file and other pages like `source/index.html.erb` to remove the Foundation-specific HTML grid and components.
